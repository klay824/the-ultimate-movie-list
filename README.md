# the-ultimate-movie-list
## The Problem:
Have you ever rented or started a movie only to figure out later that you’ve already seen it? How many times have you looked forward to a night on the couch relaxing and watching a good movie, but you don’t know what to watch? A list of what you’ve already seen and a recommendation from a reliable friend would be great.

## The Solutuion
Introducing Your Ultimate Movie Watchlist, the app that allows you to make a list of movies you want to.  Make and get recommendations from your friends .  Keep track of them your personal watchlist.

## How We Built It
We built Your Ultimate Movie Watchlist  using the following technologies:
CSS Framework: Bootstrap
Node.js
Express.js
Handlebars.js
MySQL
Sequelize ORM
Method-Override 

## Future Updates
We want to add the following features...
The ability for users to invite friends to join a movie-list group and only users within the friend group can view and comment on friends’ watched and unwatched movies.
Get the third-party API call running so we can get other data such as synopsis, ratings, critic scores and images.
Get Passport working with LocalStrategy as well as with Google, Facebook, possibly Twitter.
